# library-app
Library project from https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library

This project seems to be for summarising learnings about object constructors and prototypes.
I think I will also use this project to learn a bit about Bootstrap.

## Notes
You need to set up all the methods on your prototype before you create objects with it, otherwise those objects won't inherit the methods.
